            REFUND POLICY

----

We have a 30-day automatic refund policy on purchased but unused items, which means you have 30 days to request a refund upon purchasing a product or package from our Services.

To be eligible for an automatic refund, you must not have used your purchased items at all (e.g., no usage of either voice cloning credits nor song conversion credits). You'll also need to provide your account information for proof of purchase.

To start an automatic refund request, you can contact us at instantsinger@gmail.com or message us on our official Discord server. 

If you have used your purchased items (e.g., you have cloned your voice and/or converted songs) and are not satisfied with the quality of our Services, then you may request a monetary refund only if you have not used more than 3 song conversion credits and 1 voice cloning credit. Otherwise, you may request a refund in credits on our website; in such a case, we may refund you in credits as we deem fit. In either case, the refund quantity and approval will be determined solely at our discretion.

To request a refund, you can contact us at instantsinger@gmail.com or message us on our official Discord server.

We will notify you once we’ve approved of your refund request. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days, if a monetary refund was approved. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too. If a credit refund was approved, you will be refunded in credits on our website. 

If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your refund, please contact us at instantsinger@gmail.com.
